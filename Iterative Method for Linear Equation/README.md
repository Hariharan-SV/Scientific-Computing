# Iterative methods for solving Linear Equation

Some well known methods to solve linear equations in an iterative way are
- Gauss Elimination
- Gauss Jordan
- Gauss Jacobi
- Gauss Seidall

## Pre-requisites

One must have firm grasp of these methods in order to understand the code.

## Why without modules ?

That's the challenge. To create solution in python for these methods without using any existing modules like numpy.

## Limitations

- The code has been written in such a way to handle **only when number of equations = number of unknowns**
- Provide only diagonally dominant matrix for required ones

Note: In future the code will be made in such a way to check whether the matrix is diagonally dominant or not
